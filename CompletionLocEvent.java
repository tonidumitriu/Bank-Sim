// This subclass of CompletionEvent allows the event to store
// an index -- which will correspond to the teller in which
// the event occurs.  You will use this for Assignment 1.  The
// idea is that a CompletionLocEvent will be generated for each
// customer when the customer is "waited on" at a specific Teller.
// When the CompletionLocEvent occurs we can use the getLoc()
// method to determine which Teller should be freed.
