// This class sets up the structure and functionality of events.

// The primary attribute of an event is its time stamp.  This will
// be used to compare / order events in a system.

// By extending this class for different types of events, we enable
// the different types of events to be compatible but still
// distinguishable in an object-oriented way.  Since the time values are
// double, we do not directly compare for equality -- rather we test to see
// if the difference between the two is very small.

// Note that this class is abstract -- we will not create any SimEvent
// objects in our program. Rather, we will create objects of its subclasses.

public abstract class SimEvent implements Comparable<SimEvent>
{
    protected double e_time;  // Time when event was generated

    public SimEvent(double new_time)
    {
        e_time = new_time;
    }

    public double get_e_time()
    {
        return e_time;
    }

    // This method will allow events to be ordered (ex: via a
    // PriorityQueue)
    public int compareTo(SimEvent right)
    {
        double diff = e_time - right.e_time;
        if (Math.abs(diff) < 0.00001)
            return 0;
        else if (diff < 0)
            return -1;
        else
            return 1;
